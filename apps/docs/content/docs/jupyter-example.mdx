# Jupyter Notebook Integration

This page demonstrates how Jupyter notebooks can be integrated directly into MDX documentation.

## Features

With the `@notebook-mdx/jupyter` library, you can:

- ✅ Import `.ipynb` files directly in MDX
- ✅ Render code cells with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Display outputs (text, HTML, images)
- ✅ Show execution counts
- ✅ Customize the appearance

## Usage

First, configure your MDX pipeline:

```typescript
// source.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "fumadocs-mdx/config";
import { remarkJupyter, rehypeJupyter } from "@notebook-mdx/jupyter";

export default defineConfig({
  mdxOptions: {
    remarkPlugins: [[remarkJupyter, { executeCode: false }]],
    rehypePlugins: [[rehypeJupyter, { showCellNumbers: true }]],
  },
});
```

Then import and use notebooks in your MDX:

```mdx
import ExampleNotebook from "./example.ipynb";

<ExampleNotebook />
```

## How It Works

The library uses two plugins:

1. **`remarkJupyter`** - Parses `.ipynb` files and converts them to MDAST
2. **`rehypeJupyter`** - Transforms the HAST into React components

This follows the same pattern as other unified/remark/rehype plugins, making it composable with your existing MDX pipeline.

## Example Output

Here's what a rendered notebook would look like:

<div className="notebook-code-cell">
  <div className="notebook-code-input">
    <div className="notebook-execution-count">[1]:</div>
    <pre className="notebook-code">
      <code>{`# Simple calculation
x = 10
y = 5
result = x + y
result`}</code>
    </pre>
  </div>
  <div className="notebook-outputs">
    <div className="notebook-output-text">
      <pre>15</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Benefits

- **Build-time processing**: Notebooks are processed during build, not runtime
- **Static output**: Results in fast, static HTML like MkDocs
- **Composable**: Works with existing remark/rehype plugins
- **Customizable**: Full control over rendering components
- **Type-safe**: Built with TypeScript

## Next Steps

To implement this in your project:

1. Install the package: `npm install @notebook-mdx/jupyter`
2. Configure your MDX pipeline
3. Start importing `.ipynb` files in your MDX content

This gives you the same workflow as MkDocs-Jupyter, but in the MDX ecosystem!
